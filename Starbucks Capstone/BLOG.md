# Optimizing Marketing Strategies with Data: The Starbucks Capstone Challenge

## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, businesses thrive on understanding their customers. Starbucks, a global leader in coffee retail, offers rewards through its mobile app to engage users and enhance customer loyalty. The Starbucks Capstone Challenge presents a simulated dataset replicating customer interactions within the rewards ecosystem. By analyzing this dataset, the goal is to uncover which demographic groups respond best to specific types of offers. This analysis can help Starbucks design more personalized marketing campaigns and optimize their promotional strategies.

This blog delves into the step-by-step methodology, findings, and insights derived from the dataset, providing a comprehensive overview of how data science can refine marketing decisions.

## Section 1: Project Definition

### Project Overview

The Starbucks Capstone Challenge provides transaction, demographic, and offer data. This dataset mimics user interactions on the Starbucks rewards mobile app, where users receive different types of offers such as:
- **BOGO** (Buy One Get One Free)
- **Discounts**
- **Informational Ads**

Each offer has a defined validity period, and users may or may not interact with these offers. The dataset simplifies real-world customer behaviors by focusing on a single product. The challenge lies in combining various data sources to determine which customer segments respond most effectively to each offer type.

### Problem Statement

The project's primary objective is to identify patterns in user behavior and evaluate which demographic groups are most likely to respond to specific types of offers. This knowledge can empower Starbucks to:
1. Personalize their offers.
2. Maximize customer engagement.
3. Drive revenue growth.

### Metrics

To measure success, the following metrics are used:
1. **Offer Completion Rate:** The percentage of users who complete an offer after receiving it.
2. **Response Rate:** The percentage of users who view an offer and subsequently complete it.
3. **Revenue Impact:** The increase in transaction amounts attributed to offer views or completions.

These metrics provide a robust framework to evaluate user interactions and assess offer effectiveness.

## Section 2: Analysis

### Data Exploration

The dataset is divided into three files:
1. **Portfolio Dataset:** Contains metadata about offers, such as type, reward, and duration.
2. **Profile Dataset:** Includes demographic information like age, gender, income, and membership date.
3. **Transcript Dataset:** Logs events such as transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.

Initial exploration revealed key insights:
- **Age Distribution:** The age distribution is bell-shaped, with most users in middle age.
- **Gender Distribution:** There are significantly more males than females in the dataset.
- **Income Distribution:** Users are predominantly in the middle-income bracket, with peaks around $60,000 to $80,000.
- **Membership Trends:** The majority of users joined the rewards program in 2016–2017.

### Data Visualization

The visualizations provided clarity on:
- **Offer Popularity:** Which offer types (BOGO, Discount, or Informational) are most frequently completed.
- **Demographic Trends:** Age groups and income levels that are most active on the app.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Patterns in user activity and offer completions over time.

## Section 3: Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

Steps taken include:
1. Cleaning missing demographic data.
2. Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, offer type).
3. Normalizing numerical features such as income and transaction amounts.

### Implementation

Data integration was performed to merge the datasets, creating a unified dataset for analysis. The methodology included:
- Filtering irrelevant events (e.g., transactions not tied to offers).
- Linking offers to user demographics.
- Aggregating user activity to analyze behavior trends.

### Refinement

To ensure reliable results:
- Cross-validation was used for robustness.
- Hyperparameters were optimized for machine learning models.
- Feature scaling improved predictive accuracy.

## Section 4: Results

### Insights and Evaluation

**Offer Type Effectiveness:**
- **BOGO Offers:** Most popular and effective among young adults (ages 18–30) with higher incomes ($70,000–$120,000).
- **Discount Offers:** Appealing to middle-aged adults (ages 31–60) across all income levels, particularly those managing household budgets.
- **Informational Offers:** Engages older adults (ages 61–100), providing value without the immediate pressure of purchase completion.

**Demographic Trends:**
- **Age:** Completion rates improve after age 35, making this group a priority for targeted campaigns.
- **Gender:** Females are more likely to complete offers than males, despite similar view rates.
- **Income:** Engagement peaks in the middle-income range ($50,000–$90,000), while higher-income users demonstrate better completion rates.

### Correlation Analysis

- **Transactions:** Positively correlated with offer completions, suggesting active app users are more engaged.
- **Membership Tenure:** Slightly correlated with offer engagement, as long-term members show more consistent interaction.
- **Income:** Shows a minor correlation with completion rates, aligning with higher affordability.

### Summary of Findings

- **BOGO Offers for Higher-Income Young Adults:** Target individuals aged 18–30 with incomes between $70,000–$120,000.
- **Discount Offers for Middle-Aged Adults:** Focus on individuals aged 31–60 across all income levels.
- **Informational Offers for Older Adults:** Engage individuals aged 61–100, emphasizing awareness and education.
